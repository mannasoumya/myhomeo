      "</font></b><em><font color=\"#0000ff\">potassium permanganate for morphine poisoning": "</font></em>Potassium permanganate is recognized as being the most effective chemical antidote in cases of morphine or opium poisoning, acting directly on the morphine and oxidizing it to less toxic substances. To be effective the permanganate must come in direct contact with the opium or morphine in the stomach; hypodermatic or intravenous injections are absolutely useless, as the salt would be decomposed by the blood serum at once. The approved treatment is administration of two to five grains of potassium permanganate in dilute aqueous solution as soon as possible after the poison is taken, this amounts to be increased if very large doses of the poison have been taken. Washing out the stomach with a quantity of 1 to 500 solution of permanganate is also recommended, using at least a pint of this solution either by a stomach pump or by enforced vomiting. Permang of Potash counteracts effects of alkaloids of many poisonous plants. Owing to its oxidizing powers if given before the alkaloid has been absorbed (Dr. Chestnut in Dept of Agriculture). <p>&nbsp; <p align=\"center\"><small><strong><font color=\"#808080\">Copyright \u00a9 M\u00e9di-T 1999</font></strong></small> </blockquote> </dir> </dir></dir><p><a href=\"../index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Home</a></body></html>"
